0:00:00.200 --> 0:00:04.900
final experiment that I want to mention to you is our fan of study 

0:00:04.900 --> 0:00:16.800
and so did about 10 years ago and became very well known and I'm 

0:00:16.800 --> 0:00:25.899
going to show you the first experiment that we did Miss Betty sauerbraten we 

0:00:25.899 --> 0:00:27.399
started out with capuchin monkeys 

0:00:28.800 --> 0:00:32.700
so what do we do this we put two capuchin monkey side-by-side again these 

0:00:32.700 --> 0:00:35.299
animals that live in a group they know each other be taken out of 

0:00:35.299 --> 0:00:39.500
the group put them in a test chamber and there's a very simple task 

0:00:39.500 --> 0:00:44.000
that they need to do and if you give both of them cucumber for 

0:00:44.000 --> 0:00:48.200
the task the two monkey side-by-side the perfectly willing to do this 25 times 

0:00:48.200 --> 0:00:53.700
in a row even though it's really only water in my opinion which is 

0:00:53.700 --> 0:01:06.900
perfectly fine for them grapes and if you give them a better food than 

0:01:06.900 --> 0:01:17.000
you create an equity between them. We did recently we video tape it turned 

0:01:17.000 --> 0:01:20.099
out to be right the one on the left is a monkey who gets 

0:01:20.099 --> 0:01:23.000
to come to the one on the right is it going to get scrapes 

0:01:23.000 --> 0:01:27.299
the one who gets killed at the first piece of cucumber is perfectly fine 

0:01:27.299 --> 0:01:28.400
the first PC 

0:01:29.599 --> 0:01:32.400
 done CiCi's the other one getting rape and you will see what happens

0:01:33.900 --> 0:01:38.000
so she gives a rocks of us that's the task and we gave her 

0:01:38.000 --> 0:01:40.700
a piece of to Comanche eats it the other one needs to give a 

0:01:40.700 --> 0:01:41.299
rock to us 

0:01:42.700 --> 0:01:43.700
 and that's what she does

0:01:45.099 --> 0:01:46.700
 and she gets a grape

0:01:48.200 --> 0:01:52.500
the other one sees that she gives a rock to us now guess again 

0:01:52.500 --> 0:01:53.200
cucumber 

0:02:12.400 --> 0:02:16.199
she tests Rock now against the wall you need to give it to us 

0:02:17.599 --> 0:02:19.199
 I don't think it's cucumber again

0:02:29.000 --> 0:02:32.099
 so this is basically the Wall Street protest that you see here
